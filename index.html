            <h3>what makes our coffee special?</h3>
<p>I wanted to take this time to let you know how grateful we are to have you choosing us for your coffee needs. Quality coffee is a passion for me and I am so thankful for your patronage which allows me to do this. I wanted to share a little about our coffees, and why I think they are so special. First of all, we buy our coffee from only the most reputable farms and mills in Kona. Being a teacher in Kona for three decades,
     I taught some of the farmers and some of their parents too - which goes a long way. </p>    
       
    <p>Most boutique coffee companies sell an estate coffee, called this because every bean comes from their estate which may be an acre or two of planted coffee – exactly how we started out. When the beans are picked and dried, they end up in a variety of sizes or grades. These boutique companies roast all beans of varying size together because they cannot afford to waste any beans regardless of quality and they don’t have enough beans for it to make sense to separate them into different grades. What you end up with is an inconsistent roast – the larger beans might not be roasted enough, while the smaller beans are roasted too much and taste burnt. Our “Estate” coffee is from a single grade so you get a much more uniform roast at the perfect temperature for that size. </p></div>

                <span>by Ram desai / 21st may, 2022</span>
<p>Buying gifts for coffee lovers can be a bit overwhelming . The coffee gift space is vast. It runs the spectrum from punn-y cat mugs to the super obscure Bripe, a manual coffee brewing pipe. How do you find the right gift for a coffee enthusiast? Hopefully I can help.

    How to Buy Gifts for Coffee Lovers
    Finding the best gift for a coffee enthusiast starts with some observation. Not all coffee lovers are the same. Some are really into espresso, some are into pour-overs, some just really love good coffee. There are coffee nerds, coffee snobs and the ‘everyman’ coffee lover. You can start by observing what your gift recipient values.
    
    A great way to make these observations is to turn a conversation towards the coffee sphere. Most coffee lovers will like to talk about their passion, so ask them a few questions. These questions can be simple, direct or more covert.
    
    Where do you go from there? The more you know about the person you are buying a gift for, the easier it will be to pick a gift.
    
    If you don’t know much about your coffee enthusiast, don’t despair. Here are some ideas from a wide range of the spectrum. From coffee subscriptions to coffee artwork, the Brewing Coffee Manually blog has you covered.
    
    A Bag of Coffee and a Sweet Mug
    A quality bag of coffee and a cool mug is my go-to gift for those who want to keep it easy. I have seldom met a coffee lover that isn’t at least a little into the quest to find the perfect mug and coffee lovers like coffee. Why not give them some?
    
    If you are having trouble finding the perfect mug as a gift, I’ve written a blog post about selecting a great mug and even listed out a bunch of my favorites. Check it out: Best Coffee Mug and How to Choose the Right One.</p>             <a href="#" class="btn">read more</a>

                <a href="#" class="title">What’s So Great About Espresso?</a>
                <span>by admin / 27th june, 2022</span>
<p>Just three experiences with an espresso “god shot” and you would have your answer. As a barista in the many cafés I’ve owned, I’ve watched countless customers turn from passive, generally disinterested coffee consumers into evangelizing espresso snobs on the back of just three experience with this “elixir of the gods.” See, once you have developed a taste for the finest espresso, you just can’t drink the other stuff.

    Espresso is a process of coffee-making that was developed during the past century by the same Italian culture that has given the world such delights as the classic Barolo, Brunello, and Bolgheri wines; gelato ice cream and the dessert tiramisu; fashion brands such as Gucci, Versace, and Prada; jewelery labels such as Bulgari and Luxottica; and cars like the Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, and Lamborghini. So Italy is a culture that you can trust to deliver quality and taste perfection, and that’s what they have also done with their espresso coffee brewing method.
    
    At its simplest level, the espresso coffee brewing method extracts the best without the worst of coffee’s taste components. It’s the only coffee brewing method that can extract the best of the 800 aromatic compounds found in roasted coffee without including the naturally occurring chlorogenic acids or more commonly categorized as tannins or tannic acids. If poorly processed, these tannic acids can leach into the coffee brew, adding an astringent bitter taste that is characteristic of so many other brewing methods.
    
    Only the espresso brewing method:
    
    Grinds to beverage order and immediately captures the most delicate of the 800 aromatic compounds that are so susceptible to ambient air and moisture that they are lost within 15 minutes of grinding. (That’s why coffee often smells better than it tastes.)
    
    Uses the finest ground particles that can form the perfect resistance to an optimal high-pressure and high-temperature brewing process, so it can express the best of the aromatic compounds. Other methods use a courser grind with minimal pressure and inconsistent temperatures, often leaving the best coffee oils still trapped within these larger coffee particles and not extracted into the cup.
    
    Delivers optimal consistency to every cup by machine automating many of the steps in the brewing process, which eliminates the variances and degrading outcomes caused by erring human estimations.
    
    Delivers the long-lingering, caramelized aftertaste with its concentration and high viscosity of emulsified coffee oils that become trapped by taste receptors on the back of the tongue and throat. This slowly releases the dissolved aromatic compounds for up to 20 minutes after consumption.
    
    Has the shortest brewing cycle (20-25 seconds), which ensures that the tannic acid that occurs naturally in coffee beans with concentrations in the outer shell does not have the opportunity to break down and leach into and add bitterness to the cup as other coffee-making methods are prone to do.

                <a href="#" class="title">What's the pefect arabica / robusta ratio for coffee blends?</a>
                <span>by admin / 21st may, 2022</span>
<p>Although nowadays, we seem to be living the "omnipotence" of Arabica coffee, which is well known for its popularity, the Italian espresso tradition is based on Arabica mixing with some of the second coffee variety, Robusta.

    The blending between the two varieties aims to combine the best of them, resulting in a complex flavor profile and the texture we love in espresso. Coffee is a matter of personal taste, and its taste is a highly sensitive area, depending on many stages of its cultivation and processing. There is probably no other product with as many flavors and characteristics as coffee.
    
    In trying to map the taste and characteristics of coffee, we stand in the way of changing the profile of a blend, depending on the Arabica / Robusta ratio it contains.
    Arabica and Coffea Canephora (Robusta) exhibit very different characteristics, with which the blender "builds" the character of its blend.

    Arabica has a more complex aromatic profile, with more aromas, a rich mouth and hidden suspicions of different flavors, is significantly less bitter than its "cousin" and, depending on its variety, has strong, pronounced acidity. The variety of flavors becomes even greater if we consider that each blend ends up with more than one Arabica variety, with different flavor profiles, depending on the country of origin, the cultivation altitude, the processing and the aromas of each variety. That is why blending is a tedious and responsible job that requires deep knowledge of the coffee world, a strong sense of taste and extensive experience.
    
    Robusta, on the other hand, is clearly more "flat" tasting, but hides the virtues needed in an espresso blend. Specifically, adding Robusta to a blend gives it strength, greatly improves its body and, in the case of espresso, enhances the "cream", which is one of the main features of espresso. And if we like to enjoy espresso-based cold drinks or even espresso-milk-based beverages, such as cappuccino, latte or Flat White, then Robusta's body and power add to the blend our cup in the best way.
    
     
    
    How does a blend profile changes as the Robusta / Arabica ratio differs?
    
    Although the end result always depends on a multitude of factors, such as the quality of the grains, their roasting, their variety and the cultivation and processing conditions, we can outline - with rough lines - how the taste profile of a blend varies. depending on the proportion of Arabica and Robusta it contains.
    
     
    
    Robusta-rich blends: Content of Robusta 90%, 80% ή 70%
    
    Robusta's bitter, strong flavor is more intense, as Arabica undertakes to give just a few aromatic and tasty touches. The palette features notes of cereal, earthy aromas of wood, roasted nuts, maybe bitter cocoa and chocolate. The caffeine content is usually higher and the acidity absent. Usually these blends are highlighted by adding minimal sugar while behaving extremely well in beverages that require the addition of milk. The cream is particularly rich and the body strong, something that blends well with the cold coffee (Freddo Espresso or Freddo Cappuccino). Also ideal for espresso lungo.

    Balanced Blends: content of Robusta, 60% ή 50%
    
    The Robusta's features remain intense, but the aromas and subtle flavors of the Arabica begin to come to the fore. The cream is rich but the body intense but the acidity is balanced and the flavor is enriched with notes of milk chocolate, dried fruit, honey and more generally a more complex aromatic spectrum. The results are good in every preparation, hot or cold, with or without the addition of milk, always depending on each person's personal taste.

    Arabica-reach blends: Content of Robusta 40%, 30%, 20%
    
    This is a category in which there are many popular blends, as it is perhaps the most ideal balance between the two varieties of coffee. The aroma palette of Arabica is now unfolding, resulting in more sophisticated flavors, such as floral and fruit aromas,  while the acidity is slowly coming to the fore. At the same time, the addition of Robusta keeps the cream at a satisfactory level and promises a rich body that can withstand cold preparations and milk. A strong coffee flavor, which usually does not require sugar and is ideal for both espresso and ristretto or lungo, depending on our personal taste.</p>                <a href="#" class="btn">read more</a>
